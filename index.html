          <p>
            Boyo david is a student of alt school africa and also a 400 level
            student of biochemistry at delta state university abraka, I was born
            into the family of Mr and Mrs Boyo as the last born of a family of five,
            I'm a Christian and I hail from Delta State Warri to be precise, but
            I stay in Lagos for now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joint alt school africa with the aim of building a career in the tech
            space and learning a new skill, my drive have always been helping people
            around me and contributing to the society and i believe this a great
            medium to do that, my gaol for alt school is to take and digest every
            possible information about software engineering and connecting to a
            community that will last a lifetime.
